The Nipkow disk, also known as a scanning disk, is a mechanical device that was used in early television systems to scan an image and convert it into an electrical signal. It was invented by Paul Gottlieb Nipkow in 1884 and is named after him. The Nipkow disk is central to the design of modern spinning disk confocal microscopes, as it is used to dissect an image into a linear analog signal that can be electronically transmitted and then reassembled at a remote site.

The Nipkow disk consists of a disk with a series of holes arranged in a spiral pattern around its circumference. When the disk is rotated, the holes pass over a light source, such as a lamp or a cathode ray tube, and the light is transmitted through the holes onto a photosensitive surface, such as a photoelectric cell or a cathode ray tube. This produces an electrical signal that is proportional to the intensity of the light at each position on the surface.

The Nipkow disk was an important early development in the history of television, as it was the first device capable of scanning an image and converting it into an electrical signal. However, it had several limitations, including a low scan rate and low resolution, which made it impractical for use in modern television systems. Despite these limitations, the Nipkow disk remains an important piece of technological history and is still used in some educational and research applications, including in modern spinning disk confocal microscopes.

"How to Build a Home Televisor: A Brand New Thrill" written by H. G. Cisin, M.E.  

The article  discusses the construction of a television receiver using a kit provided by the Jenkins Television Corporation. The design of the receiver includes features such as a band-pass filter for tuning to a specific frequency range, an extra stage of radio frequency for increased sensitivity, and shielding and resistance coupling in the audio amplifier. The instructions for building the receiver provide detailed steps for assembling and attaching various components, including electromagnets, coils, shafts, ball bearings, and screws. The importance of properly adjusting the distance between the rotor and magnet cores is also emphasized. The receiver can be synchronized using an "eddy current" motor, a speed-control rheostat, or an automatic synchronizer, and it uses a neon lamp in the lamp house.
